**Example** (Production SRE):
```
Before: "Monitor your systems"

After: "Observability Before Monitoring: Can't monitor what you can't observe - 
       instrument FIRST. Real case: Uber's 2015 outage lasted 4 hours because 
       they had monitoring but not observability - couldn't diagnose root cause. 
       After adding distributed tracing, MTTR dropped from 4h to 15min."
```

### **Code Production Readiness** (5x increase)

## 🎓 Key Learnings - What Made the Difference

### **1. Workflow is King**
The single biggest differentiator between L3.5 and L4.8 is workflow depth:
- L3.5: "Do X" (what)
- L4.8: "Week 1, Day 1-3: Meet CEO, CTO, CFO. Ask these 10 questions..." (exactly how, when, who)

### **2. Specificity > Generality**
Real numbers beat vague guidance:
- Bad: "Improve performance"
- Good: "Reduce p99 latency from 2.5s to 850ms using caching (70% hit rate) and batch processing"

### **3. Battle Scars Matter**
Real production experience encoded as best practices:
- "Buffer Before Bottleneck: 10-15% throughput improvement for free - learned from Toyota Production System"

### **4. Code Must Be Production-Grade**
Example code should be copy-paste ready:
- Error handling, monitoring, retries, cost tracking, security
- Not just "proof of concept"

### **5. Context is Critical**
Every recommendation needs "why":
- "Use differential privacy (epsilon=1.0)" ← useless alone
- "Use differential privacy (epsilon=1.0) because model inversion attacks can extract 30% of training data with 1000 queries" ← actionable
