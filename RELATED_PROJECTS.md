**Repository**: [glen200392/enterprise-ai-architects](https://github.com/glen200392/enterprise-ai-architects)

### What It Is

Enterprise AI Architect Team is a specialized network of **20 elite-tier AI agents** focused on strategic AI system design, architecture, and governance for enterprise deployments.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | FDE Super Team (This Repo) | Enterprise AI Architects |
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Focus** | Tactical project execution | Strategic architecture & design |
| **Team Size** | 24 agents | 20 agents |
| **Primary Users** | Forward Deployed Engineers | Enterprise architects, CTOs, technical leaders |
| **Core Scenarios** | Client projects, migrations, on-site delivery | AI platform design, LLMOps, governance |
| **Expertise Depth** | Broad (multi-domain) | Deep (AI-specialized) |
| **Capability Level** | L3.5-4.5 | L4.5-4.8 (Elite tier) |

### When to Use Each

#### Use **FDE Super Team** When:
- You need to **deliver a complete project** from requirements to deployment
- Working with **legacy system migrations** or **cloud migrations**
- Handling **ambiguous client requirements** that need clarification
- Require **on-site execution** and cross-functional coordination
- Need **broad technical coverage** across multiple domains

#### Use **Enterprise AI Architects** When:
- Designing **enterprise-scale AI platforms** from scratch
- Need **strategic guidance** on AI adoption and governance
- Architecting **LLMOps pipelines** and production AI systems
- Require **security architecture** and compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA)
- Optimizing **AI system performance** and cost at scale
- Building **RAG systems**, **agent orchestration**, or **HITL workflows**

### Synergy: How They Work Together

        └──────── Feedback ──────────┘
```

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Enterprise AI Architects** design the AI platform architecture
2. **FDE Super Team** executes the implementation across client sites
3. **FDE Team** provides field feedback on practical challenges
4. **AI Architects** refine patterns and best practices

**Combined Value**: Strategic vision meets practical execution, with continuous learning loops.
