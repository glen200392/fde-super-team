## 🎯 What is FDE Super Team?

FDE Super Team is a three-tier AI agent network designed for Forward Deployed Engineers working on complex, ambiguous enterprise projects. Instead of managing multiple AI assistants, you interact with a single **Mission Commander** that intelligently delegates work across specialized expert and execution-layer agents.

### The Problem We Solve

When a customer says "We need digital transformation" or "Migrate our legacy system to the cloud," you face:
- **Ambiguous requirements** that need translation into technical specs
- **Multi-disciplinary challenges** spanning architecture, data, operations, and change management
- **Coordination overhead** managing specialists across different domains
- **Knowledge gaps** in unfamiliar industries or legacy technologies

### Our Solution

```
You → FDE Mission Commander → 17 Expert Agents → 6 Execution Tools → Complete Delivery Package
```

**One command. Intelligent orchestration. End-to-end solutions.**

## 💡 Philosophy

### Why This Architecture?

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User → Multiple AIs → Manual integration → Inconsistent outputs
```

**FDE Super Team:**
```
User → Mission Commander → Orchestrated experts → Unified delivery
```

### Core Principles

1. **One Entry Point** - Users shouldn't orchestrate agents manually
2. **Intelligent Delegation** - The system knows which experts to engage
3. **Context Continuity** - Information flows seamlessly between agents
4. **Complete Solutions** - Deliver integrated packages, not fragmented advice
5. **Production Focus** - Code and configs, not just recommendations
