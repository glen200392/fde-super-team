- ✅ Access to conversation interface
- ✅ 5 minutes of time
- ✅ A process problem you want to solve

**No coding required for this quick start!**

## 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Identify Your Bottleneck (1 min)

Think of a process that's causing pain:
- ❌ Deployment takes 4 hours
- ❌ Customer support backlog growing
- ❌ Data pipeline failing frequently
- ❌ Review process blocking releases

### Step 2: Engage Process Diagnostics (2 min)

Ask the team:
```
@Process-Bottleneck-Diagnostics

Our deployment process takes 4 hours end-to-end:
- Code review: 60 min
- CI/CD pipeline: 90 min
- Manual testing: 45 min
- Deployment: 45 min

Team: 5 engineers, deploying 3x per day
Tools: GitHub, Jenkins, AWS

Where is the bottleneck and how do we fix it?
```

**What you'll get:**
- ✅ Bottleneck identification
- ✅ Root cause analysis
- ✅ Prioritized improvement plan
- ✅ Expected impact (time/cost saved)

### Step 3: Analyze ROI (2 min)

```
@ROI-Analysis-Expert

Analyze the ROI of the recommended improvements:
- Current cost: 5 engineers × 4 hours × 3 deploys/day
- Implementation cost: [from previous output]
- Timeline: [from previous output]

Calculate NPV, payback period, and IRR.
```

**What you'll get:**
- ✅ Financial justification
- ✅ Break-even analysis
- ✅ Sensitivity scenarios
- ✅ Executive summary

**Done!** You now have a data-driven improvement plan with financial justification.

## What to Expect

### Response Format
Agents provide:
- ✅ **Analysis:** Data-driven findings
- ✅ **Recommendations:** Prioritized actions
- ✅ **Code/Config:** Implementation examples
- ✅ **Metrics:** Success criteria

### Response Time
- Simple analysis: 30-60 seconds
- Complex diagnostics: 1-2 minutes
- Full implementation plans: 2-3 minutes

### Follow-Up Capability
You can iterate:
```
"Can you show the Python code for that?"
"What if we only implement the top 2 recommendations?"
"Create a Gantt chart for the 3-month implementation"
```

## Tips for Success

### ✅ DO: Provide Context
```
Good: "Deployment takes 4 hours. Team of 5, deploying 3x/day, 
using GitHub + Jenkins. Bottleneck appears to be in testing."

Bad: "Deployments are slow"
```

### ✅ DO: Specify Constraints
```
"Budget max: $50K"
"Must complete in 6 weeks"
"Cannot change database"
"Need SOC 2 compliance"
```

### ✅ DO: Request Specific Formats
```
"Provide as Python script"
"Create Excel-compatible CSV"
"Generate Gantt chart"
"Show as JSON"
```

### ❌ DON'T: Ask Multiple Unrelated Questions
```
Bad: "Optimize deployment AND reduce cloud costs AND fix performance"

Good: Create separate threads for each topic
```

### ❌ DON'T: Withhold Critical Information
```
Bad: "Fix our performance" [doesn't mention stack, scale, constraints]

Good: "Fix API performance. Stack: Python/FastAPI. 
Scale: 500 QPS. Latency: 2.5s p95. Target: <500ms. Budget: $20K"
```
